## Introduction
The Cloud-Based Inter College Announcement System aims to replace traditional notice boards with a digital platform. It provides a centralized space for broadcasting announcements, facilitating two-way communication, and enhancing the overall efficiency of information dissemination in a college environment.

## Features
- **Announcement Broadcasting:** Admins can broadcast announcements to all students.
- **Bi-directional Communication:** Students can respond and interact with admins.
- **Group Messaging:** Creation of groups for specific announcements or discussions.
- **Dynamic Content:** Supports multimedia content for engaging announcements.

## System Architecture
The system is divided into a cloud-based server and two client groups: Admin and Students. The server handles message broadcasting, while clients use APIs for communication. The project utilizes Microsoft Azure for cloud services and Java for backend development.
